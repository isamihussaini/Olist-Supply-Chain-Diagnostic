# Python Diagnostic Forensics

This folder contains the Python automation scripts used to perform deep-dive forensics on order-level data.

### Analysis Focus:
* **Wait-Time Distribution:** Calculating the exact spread of delivery delays across different logistics corridors.
* **Seller Complexity Analysis:** Using Pandas to correlate the number of unique sellers in an order with the probability of a delivery failure.
* **Automated Visualization:** Using Matplotlib/Seaborn to create executive-ready diagnostic plots.

**Main Script:** `diagnostic_master_script.py`
